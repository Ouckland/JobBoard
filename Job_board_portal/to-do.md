Got it 👍 Keeping it simple now is the best approach.
Here’s a **clear checklist review** of your JobBoard project based on what you’ve told me you’ve already done and what’s still pending:

---

## ✅ What You Have Done

1. **Authentication & Signup**

   * Email + password signup.
   * OTP verification.
   * Choice of account type (seeker/employer).
   * Profile creation before login.

2. **Profile System**

   * Seeker and Employer profiles built.
   * Create, Read, Update done (no delete).
   * Progress bar for profile completion.

3. **Public Features**

   * Public profile pages (`/profile/<slug>/`).
   * Public directory (Browse Candidates / Browse Employers).

4. **Dashboard**

   * Separate dashboards for seekers and employers.
   * Job search + filters for seekers.
   * Employers see active jobs and applications.
   * Stats included.

5. **Job Postings & Applications**

   * Employers can post jobs.
   * Seekers can apply to jobs.
   * Applications stored & linked to jobs.

6. **Notifications**

   * Basic notifications with AJAX “mark as read”.

7. **Styling**

   * Ocean/dark theme applied.
   * Header with responsive navbar.

## 🔲 What’s Still Left (Keep It Simple Version)

Here’s what I recommend you focus on now before enhancements:

### A. **Application Review (Current Task)**

* Employer should be able to:

  * View applicants for a job.
  * See applicant profile details & CV.
  * Update application status (shortlisted, interviewed, rejected, hired).
* Seeker should be able to:

  * View all jobs they’ve applied to.
  * Track their application status (e.g., pending → shortlisted → hired/rejected).

### B. **Basic Search & Filtering Improvements**

* Make search filters consistent for **seekers and employers** (you already started).
* Add responsive styling so filters look good on mobile.

### C. **Mobile-first Styling Review**

* Refactor layouts (dashboards, job listings, profile, search filters, applications) so they work cleanly on small screens.

## 🚀 Enhancements for Later (Phase 2)

(Don’t worry about these yet, but good to plan)

* Messaging system (you scrapped it, maybe add later).
* Advanced job matching / recommendations.
* Saved jobs & saved candidates.
* Analytics for employers (views, reach).
* Subscription/payment system.

---

👉 So your **next milestone** is:
**Build the application review system (employer → review/manage applications, seeker → track applications)** and make sure it looks good on mobile.

Do you want me to prepare a **step-by-step build plan for the application review feature** (models → views → templates → styling), so you can implement it smoothly?
